# Hello Web App
This repo follows Tracy Osborn's <em>Hello Web App </em> book. <br>
Excellent instructions and great support. <br>
I highly recommend this book; you can <a href="https://hellowebapp.com/order">order a copy</a> for yourself, too. <br>
Workshop was held on Saturday, September 26, 2015 in San Francisco.<br>
